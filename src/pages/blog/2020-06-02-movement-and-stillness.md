description: There is a power of resisting by which every body, as much as in
  it  lies, endeavours to preserve its present state, whether it be of rest or
  of  moving uniformly

*I feel the burgeoning energy of commitment*\
*Coursing through my blood*\
*Seeking purpose*\
\
*As focus finds it's feet*\
*My mind begins to cut through  the vacant layers*\
*Where peaceless yammering fills the void*\
*Where valuable instruments*\
*Lie cast aside, unused*\

Following my feet this evening I went on an adventure. It was a small adventure, a matter of just a few blocks. But it filled with me wonderlust. At times I've been so full of wonderlust I could hardly stop moving, whatever the desire in me to settle. In days filled with computer work, I feel so sedantry that the mere thought of going outside ceases to entire my consciousness.\
\
In both of these states lies goodness, joy, and health. And too much of either hurts my heart. I crave the movement. I crave the stillness. I long for the stillness of a moment and I yearn for the wonder of spontaniety.\

My heart is heavy tonight as I watch fearfully what is unfolding across the ocean. I feel the stirring, the movement, and hold dearly in my heart the hope for the transformation that this enables. May the fierce love that guides it continue to shine bright, that all those who turn towards it see it's beautiful light, and are in turn inspired towards it's goodness.
