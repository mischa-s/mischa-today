*Minute by minute*\
*Hour by hour*\
*Day by day*\
\
*Becomings start in small moments*\
*Building slowly*\
\
*They do not disappear*\
*After the grande reveal*\
*They contine becoming*\
*Moment upon moment*

I notice the difference in my body, when I am called to summon my whole being in a moment. The sharpeness, the focus, the rush of blood. In the sleepy moments, the sharpness fades. My mind wanders. It is in these moments that I must discipline myself. To perservere. To focus. To continue, minute by minute, to practice.
