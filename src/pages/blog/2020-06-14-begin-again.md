*Begin again*\
*Discover the moment*

Waking up this morning I choose to begin again. Last week was a challenging week. This morning is a new morning and I can choose how I meet it. I can choose to carry the burdens from last week and drag myself down before I start, or I can begin again. Start fresh. Practice making the choices I want to make. Choose gratitude. Reverence. Hope. Peace. Kindness. Begin again.
