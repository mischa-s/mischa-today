*Patterns, repeated day by day*\
*Become habits, repeated week after week*\
*Become rituals, repeated year after year*\
*Become laws, broken every day*

On a personal level, day after day I keep trying and failing and trying again to pracitice what I need. On a global scale I'm amazed as day after day the conversation about race continues. And I strive to have the patience to always show up to the conversations that matter, but also to show up to myself, with the trust that showing up to myself will lead me to the conversations that matter when my being there matters.
