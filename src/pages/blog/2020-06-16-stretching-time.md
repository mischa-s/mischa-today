  To see a World in a Grain of Sand
  And a Heaven in a Wild Flower 
  Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand 
  And Eternity in an hour

*Stretching time*\
*A moment becomes an hour*

*Compacting time*\
*An hour passes in heart beat*

*Each day we chose*\
*How fast the time will fly*

As a flex and bend my time, the question arrives. What will you do with your time. Falling into bed exhausted, I can't possibly contemplate doing more. But each day I take on more, when I balance it with discipline, patience, and conscious direction of attention, I notice my muscle for working with time grows stronger. How I spend my time is my choice. I can chose both how I spend it and how I fill it.
