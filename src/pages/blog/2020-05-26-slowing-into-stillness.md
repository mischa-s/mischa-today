title: Slowing into stillness

description: Poetry slows you down... Anything in our world now that slows us
  down, is to be valued, and maybe is a gift and even a calling from God
main: >-
  Sitting in stillness I find myself\

  Grasping for fragments to chase\

  Searching for form to contextualize the vastness\

  Jittering away from impermanence

  Today I made some choices about how I want to be.


  I am grateful for all the people in the world who I love. I went for a walk with a friend on Sunday and they asked me about who I would miss and I was filled with warmth thinking of all of the people I love.


  I forgive myself my imperfections, though they are many, and commit myself to practice

  Today I am inspired again by an episode of On Being with Krista Tippett, this one featuring Wendell Berry and Ellen Davis entitled [The Art of Being Creature](https://onbeing.org/programs/wendell-berry-ellen-davis-the-art-of-being-creatures/). Recently I have noticed a change in how I am with myself. For a long time I have valued my enjoyment of sitting in stillness and observing. Silence. Outwardly doing nothing. Yet these days those moments of stillness are few and my peace in this place is fleeting. 


  I first heard these lines from Wendell Berry a few weeks ago and hearing them again today, I hear in them what I must now remember:


  *Make a place to sit down.*\

  *Sit down. Be quiet.*  


  *out of the silence, like prayers*\

  *prayed back to the one who prays,*\

  *make a poem that does not disturb*\

  *the silence from which it came.*

  *How to Be a Poet*


  Make a place to sit down.\

  Sit down. Be quiet.\

  You must depend upon\

  affection, reading, knowledge,\

  skill—more of each\

  than you have—inspiration,\

  work, growing older, patience,\

  for patience joins time\

  to eternity. Any readers\

  who like your poems,\

  doubt their judgment.


  ii


  Breathe with unconditional breath\

  the unconditioned air.\

  Shun electric wire.\

  Communicate slowly. Live\

  a three-dimensioned life;\

  stay away from screens.\

  Stay away from anything\

  that obscures the place it is in.\

  There are no unsacred places;\

  there are only sacred places\

  and desecrated places.


  iii


  Accept what comes from silence.\

  Make the best you can of it.\

  Of the little words that come\

  out of the silence, like prayers\

  prayed back to the one who prays,\

  make a poem that does not disturb\

  the silence from which it came.
