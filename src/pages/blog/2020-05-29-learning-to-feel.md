  *Feelings flash*\

  *Blood rushes*


  *Time contracts*\

  *Vision narrows*\

  \

  *Time*\

  S*lows*\

  \

  *Self*\

  *Expands*\

  \

  *Finger*\

  T*ips*\

  Ti*ngle*\

  \

  *Breath*\

  W*ashes*\

  I*n*


  *Breath*\

  Washes\

  Out\

  \

  I remember the sense of wonder I felt the first time I realized I was living in a body. Feeling my sense of self permeating the physical essence. Later, I remember noticing how this permeation changed as emotions made themselves known. Like thoughts which appear in my consciousness and which I can poke and prod. If I am paying attention I can watch the emotions arise. With practice I've found I can feel into them with different parts of my body.\

  \

  If I'm not paying attention they can take over my body. I remember being amazed when I discovered that most of the anger I've felt, if I sit with it, has it's root in frustration and sadness. Today I am feeling anger, fear, frustration, sadness, grief. I notice I am not chasing these feelings away but rather leaning in to them. Listening to them. Asking them for their wisdom. Searching within them for the answers to the horrors playing out across the ocean. There are of course horrors everywhere of many varieties, but today the acute pain of a nation, embodied in the twin cities, looms large.\

  \

  The world needs leaders who practice feeling, who can sift through the layers of feelings rather than being blinded by them.
