*Wrapped within these walls*\
*I hold lengthy discourse with myself*\
*Trusting my poor memory*\
*To overlook any foibles in my thinking*\
\
*Watching the world*\
*Through the arrow slits in my tower*\
*I feel enticed to contemplate*\
*Leaving the safety of these walls*\

When I told my mum that I was writing a blog, she asked me, "who is it for?" "What makes it a blog?" "Aren't blogs normally written for other people?" I have now managed to successfully write something for a week straight. This was my initial goal. Not as as stopping point but as a starting point. Begin the habit of writing daily. In public. For myself.\
\
I am afraid of how these writings will meet the world. How they will look in five, ten, or twenty years. This is the reason for the caveats that sit atop this page.

I know that in this moment, the world could care less about what is written here. But I also know how the internet works and that these writings could one day be drudged up, and if they are it will probably be out of context.\
\
So I've decided to use this as the context to initiate a dialogue with myself. To snapshot whatever is on top. Maybe, overtime, I'll feel the confidence to actively share some of the snapshots with others. But for now the audience is me.\
\
This is my dialogue, with myself, theoritically in public, but with no one watching.
