*The fresh damp odour*\
*Rises gently to meet me*

*The little smells of new life*\
*Nourished by the morning dew*

Yesterday morning I was up early. The day before was 15 hours of computer time and only ten minutes outside. So I went for a walk. To ground myself. To connect to myself. To remeber the world beyond the screen. Immediately as I set off I noticed the smells. Tucked into the hillside as we are, the smells surrounding our house are of life. As I climbed the stairs up to the street I was in awe of the sweet, rich dampness that I inhaled. As I reached the street, cars begin to pass by. The smells and the air in my lungs all took on a very different quallity. I don't have words to describe it - it just felt gross.After an hour long walk, mostly through woods filled with rich smells of life, I noticed again as soon as I encountered a car how terrible they smell.\
\
During lockdown it was amazing to see so many people out walking the streets. I myself spent hours roaming streets I'd never noticed before around my house. Walking those streets now I realize that a huge part of what made it such a pleasent experience was the lack of cars. Would this be different with electric cars? Maybe?\
\
At least it might smell different.\

But the real point for me is how do we do this better? How can we create places to live that are free from petrol and hurtling messes of metal.  The contrast between the countryside and the city would be much less extreme if cities werent filled with cars.
