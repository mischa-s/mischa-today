"Momentum is the product of the velocity and the inertial mass of the object while inertia indicates how hard it is to change the current state of the system." - [the internet](https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-momentum-and-vs-inertia/) 

I found myself thinking this morning about the relationship between the two concepts of Inertia and momentum. The definition above is the most succinct summary of this that I could find. How fast it is moving vs how hard it is to effect it's movement.

As I begin again, and again, and again, to look at the patterns in my life, I notice the interplay of these two concepts. The ease of writing a blog, having already gotten it moving, building on preexisting momentum. The challenges of re-imagining my time, difficult to initiate but once in motion continuing to move after the impulse fades, inertia.

Making purchasing choices which align with my values, easier each time I do it - momentum. Making changes to my underlying decision model to consider environmental impact, a big, hard to move, but once in motion, continued movement - inertia.

The use of the words momentum and inertia in the preceding two paragraphs refer to the quality I notice rather than the sole operating principle. Both are present on either side of the false dichotomies I have drawn. But what I have highlighted are the focal points of my experience in those situations. The feeling of momentum, the ease of riding a wave. The feeling of inertia - the challenge of getting a ball rolling.

Because I notice once I can name those feelings, I can more easily work with them.
