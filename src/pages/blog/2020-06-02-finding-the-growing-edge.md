*Stretching beyond the familiar*\
*I notice my uncertainty*\
\
"*We don't know how to do this"*\
*My mind shouts at me*\
\
*"Not yet", I reply*\
*"But lets rummage around our tool bag*\
*And try things on for size"*

Somewhere between my expectations of myself and what I am comfortable doing, is what I am capable of. The further I get from my comfort zone, the less tools I have at my disposal. If I sit too close to my comfort zone, my tools grow dull from lack of use.\
\
My goal is to push myself to the place where I have as many tools as possible at my disposal, but none are tailor made for the job at hand, so that I continue to learn new ways of using them, without submerging myself so deep that I sink beneath the waves of overwhelm and am cast back to instinctual survival mechanisms just to catch a breath.
