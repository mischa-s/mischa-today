*From the crest of the wave*\
*I look to the water below with dispair*\
\
*From beneath the wave*\
*I look up at it's majesty in terror*\
\
*The ocean, oblivious to this*\
*Continues to rise and fall*\
*As it heaves it's way to the shore*

Taking a step back from my week I notice the crescendoes diminuendoes. My highs and my lows. In energy, in enthusiasm, in motivation.\
\
I am trying not to beomce to preoccupied with any of these, but merely to ride them and notice: where am I? where have I been?
