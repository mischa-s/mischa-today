description: It's the little things

  *Give in to grand gesture*\

  *Sweeping change calls out*\

  *In a single moment*\

  *Make your mark*\

  It's the little things. Gosh it took me a long time being to learn it and I am learning still. I notice how step boldly a moment and then fade away as it passes. I watch in awe at the persistence of those small benign gestures, like water carasseing stone, wear smooth the roughest edges.\

  I find myself in the constrasts and the meeting of chaos and form. I remember stumbling upon the turn of phrase, "the living edge between finely tuned systems and emergent behaviour", as I struggled to find a side of the fence to stand upon. In places of chaos I find form and in places of form I find chaos.


  It is this dance which has led me here. Pulled me away from myself so that I can become somebody else striving to be myself. Letting go of the theory leaving myself no escape but the practice, carrying with me only the principles, boiled down to an essence. Slow down
