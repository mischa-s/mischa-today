  repeated because they feel safe.

  *As I chastise my being into stillness*\

  *My mind slowly wanders away*\

  *Seeking out the habitual distractions*\

  *That keep me separate from myself*


  The initial inspiration for this blog was when I began receiving [Seth Godin's daily blog](http://seth.blog/). This discover was once again sparked by On Being with Krista Tippett, in her interview with Seth Godin entitled [Life, the Internet, and Everything](https://onbeing.org/programs/seth-godin-life-the-internet-and-everything-sep2018/).


  I registered this domain shortly after that time, and have received Seth's daily blog ever since then. It is one of only two blogs I subscribe to, the other being [Kent C Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/)', which I subscribe to for work. The words in the subtitle of this blog are from a recent post by Seth. Usually I just read his posts, absorb them, pass them on if I'm inspired - and then delete them (I know they are always on his website if I really need to find them later). But when I read this one 4 months ago, it spoke to me, and I've left it in my inbox (I generally maintain a very small inbox, currently it stands at 14 and I'm painfully aware of needing to move stuff along).


  And it is why I have started again on this endeavour. I am striving to write something each day. As I step back towards myself with consciousness, I am beginning to make small choices. Today I made some small choices about I would be. I am grateful for the space to make those choices. I continue to feel inadequate but forgive myself my mistakes. Little by little, I will try to dig beautiful ruts.\

  Ruts don’t dig themselves.


  Most of the time, we’re in a rut because that’s precisely where we put ourselves.


  Actions become habits, and habits get repeated because they feel safe.


  The easiest way to make things more interesting is to simply stop repeating your habitual behavior.


  And that often comes from reacting to triggers. Remove the triggers and you can alter the habits.


  Tiny changes. Different ways to keep score.


  Tomorrow comes daily. But we don’t have to take the same route to get there.
