With trepidation I wade again\
Into the river of time\
With humble heart\
And wary mind  

I am inspired to make this foray by the recent episode of [On Being with Krista Tippett featuring Jacqueline Novogratz - Towards a Moral Revolution](https://onbeing.org/programs/jacqueline-novogratz-towards-a-moral-revolution/). I enjoyed it so much I listened to it twice. Towards the end of the podcast, they speak about the Daily Examen, and Jacqueline speaks about her adaptation of it.

1. Start with intention: what do you want to accomplish in the day - who do you want to be?
2. Checkin with yourself later, ask yourself how you did - do an account. What did you learn from it?
3. Importantly, forgive yourself for what you didn't do or what you did poorly
4. Express gratitude

> *"I TRY to do it every day, I don't do it every day, but when I do do it my day is different"*  *\- Jacquline Novagrats*

A simple formula, one I have encountered many times in my life. One which I have taken for granted. Throughout my life I can remember many times where I have spoken with friends about the importance of practice. I have been asked "do you meditate or have some other form of daily practice", to which I have replied, "No. While I can see the value of it, for me the objective is to be in that place of practice in each moment."

Each time I have said this, I have also been aware that there would likely come a time in my life where I would need to cultivate my connection to self with more devoted consciousness. Sitting in my bed now, feeling the restless unease of an undesciplined inner life, I see clearly an opportunity to cultivate and to grow that which will serve me.
