*Between the folds of time*\
*Lines are drawn*

*Collapsing disparate events*\
*In a single moment*

This morning I am filled with gratitude. For those I love. For the warmth of fire. For the movement of water. For the life of forests. For the majesty of mountains. For moments in time. For timelessness.

Yesterday was nourishing day, sitting by a fire in the woods, in the company of dear friends. As the conversation flowed an observation was made. Over the last few months the whole world has slowed down and experienced a shared event. We have been united by a common experience, despite the experiences of it being so incredibly different for so many reasons. And so many people had no distraction from this. Nothing else to focus their attention on - no distractions from daily life. The confluence of these two factors of unity and quiet time seem inextricably connected with what now feels possible. With the wave of solidarity around washing across the globe. With more and more people stepping out of othering or turning a blind eye and saying, "black lives matter".
