  *Easing out of the tightly wound coil of my mind*\

  *I slip into the observer*\

  *As I watch the thoughts roll past*\

  \

  *When it dawns on me*\

  *I am once more being dragged along*\

  *I release my hold on the thought*\

  *I fall back to observation*\

  \

  In a world that is consistently on, turning off can be a challenge. I have noticed recently that the whirring of my mind has gone into overdrive - so much so that my head starts to hurt. When I take the time to sit with this, I am astonished at the torrent of thoughts clamouring for attention.\

  \

  Today I am grateful for my mind. I do not understand it. But when the thoughts overwhelm me, I can lay my head down on a pillow (preferably in the sun) and drift off. When I come to, my mind has filtered all of the thoughts for me and leaves me with just a few. This is a minor miracle. As I bring awareness to my thinking I notice how I can do this house keeping more regularly to reduce the volcanic eruption of thoughts. Slowing down. Letting go. Feeling gratitude. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing.
