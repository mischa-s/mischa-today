   “Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing
  and rightdoing there is a field.
  I'll meet you there.

  When the soul lies down in that grass
  the world is too full to talk about.”

*In the sirling chaos of my mind*\
*I notice a still place at the center*

*A quiet place*\
*A peaceful place*\

These last weeks and months have stirred me up and unsettled me. From a global pandemic to global protests against racism, I notice myself constantly drawn in to the news cycle. I feel distant from it here in New Zealand. There is systemic racism here, particularly regarding Maori and Pacific folks, and the global pandemic did shut down the society here for the better part of two months. Yet these pale in comparison to events abroad.

Seeking within myself, I must find my own alignment. I must not become numb or faded. I must not try to blunt the pain I feel for this pain is a teacher and a guide. Yet I must trust my path. For now, my focus must remain on getting my mind back on track. Desciplining my thinking. Honing my skillset. I can only serve with that which I can offer.\

Today I will seek to remember peacefulness.Today I will seek to pracice gratitude.
