A few years ago when seeking to describe myself, I stumbled upon the phrase 

> I am fascinated by the living edge between finely tuned systems and emergent behaviour

Earlier in my life, I might have framed this as a question - "which is better, finely tuned-systems or emergent behaviour". In the moment of time, my focus is on where the two meet. I have observed recently in my work life that I will sometimes work from the one side and sometimes from the other. In structured environments I will frequently disrupt the systems, and in highly dynamic environments I create systems and form.\
\
My experience is that individuals are very different in their comfort level on the chaos spectrum. Some people find systems stifling while others are completely overwhelmed by formlessness. Somewhere in the middle, we meet, and call it society. I was reflecting yesterday on [this piece by Trevor Noah](https://www.facebook.com/TrevorNoah/videos/271546193965209/) about agreements. About what happens when they agreements we think we've made are not being upheld.

The condemnation of protests is an able to respect the finely tuned system - is deaf to it's brokenness and the requirement for it to evolve in the way that most systems evolve - emergent behaviour.

I look at my own life - where chaos and order meet in me. Over the last couple of years I have begun to settle, and act of order. I have begun creating rhythms and structures that I can fall back on. I feel gateful for the strength and stability this provides me. I also observe the deadening in brings with it. As I find form I must also cultivate spontenaity - chaos, to keep my system healthy. To not neglect important parts of myself and settle into the warm comforts of oblivion.
