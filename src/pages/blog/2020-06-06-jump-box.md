Recently I learned how to use a jumpbox to SSH into a remote server that required a static IP. A colleague who had done it before walked me through it and I was amazed how simple it was. That being said, there were definitely a few wrinkles to iron out to get it working.\
\
The key steps were:

* Setup up an EC2 instance (I used a ubuntu image for easy)
* Add a key pair to the instance so that it would recognize my machine
* Ensure my private key coming from the jumpbox would match what the remote server was expecting (for some reason I couldn't get forwarding to  work and was in a rush so just put my key on the box, but hypothetically it should be possible to just forward it)

There are lots of fancier ways to configure everything so that I could use my local env and just have it recognize when I wanted it to actually carry out commands on the remote server, but for a quick and dirty I was very pleased with how easliy it worked
